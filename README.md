# Understanding and Detecting Bugs in Network Systems (Course project of CSCI5570, Spring 2021)
## Overview
Network systems connect the Internet world nowadays. The bugs in network systems can lead to denial-of-service, performance issues, etc. To the best of my knowledge, the bugs in network systems have not been well studied and understood. The potential security impact has not been well investigated as well. In this project, we aim to understand the bugs in network systems. We hope to learn lessons to further guide the new bug detection.
