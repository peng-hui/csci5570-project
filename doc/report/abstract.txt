Network systems connect the Internet world.  Bugs in network systems can
lead to denial-of-service, performance issues, etc.  Understanding
network system bugs can benefit both the system developers and security
analysts.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the bugs in network systems have
not been well understood.  The potential security impact has not been
well investigated as well.  In this project, we aim to understand the
bugs in network systems.  We hope to learn lessons to further guide
future bug detection in network systems.
