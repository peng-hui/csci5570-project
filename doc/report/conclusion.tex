\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}
In this work, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of TCP incast control.
We present an in-depth exploration of existing solutions to tackle TCP incast congestion problem.
We categorize the solutions by their implemented network architecture layers and outline the general challenges of the problem.
We show that the feedback mechanism is a practical approach to monitor the network traffic and prevent TCP incast congestion.
We probe several limitations in prior works and introduce potential future work on this topic.
Though well studied, there are still potential directions that can be further explored to improve the state-of-the-art works.
We do hope this study can shed some light on future research of TCP incast control.
