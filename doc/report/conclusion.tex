\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}
Performance bugs in network operating systems are previously understudied.
%
This paper conducted a systematic study to understand the characteristics of the performance bugs.
We designed \sys with several new techniques to detect performance bugs in the wild.
%
Our evaluation demonstrates report de-duplication is necessary and our solution is effective.
%
We hope our research, as an initial step, can shed some light on future security analysis and software developments.
