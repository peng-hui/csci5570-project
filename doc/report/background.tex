\subsection{Performance Bugs}

Performance bugs in a program could degrade its performance and waste computational resources.
%
Usually, people define performance bugs as software defects where relatively simple \emph{source-code} changes can significantly optimize the execution of the software while preserving the functionality \cite{perfbugstudy, killian2010finding, s2e}.
%
There can be several different performance issues regarding different categories of resources.
%
For example, some performance bugs could cause excessive CPU resource utilization, resulting in unexpectedly longer execution time; 
%
some other bugs could lead to huge memory consumption because of uncontrolled memory allocation and memory leak \cite{wen2020memlock}.

Performance bugs lead to reduced throughput, increased latency, and wasted resources in software.
%
They particularly impact the end-user experiences.
%
What is worse, when a buggy application is deployed on the web servers, the bugs can be exploited by attackers for denial-of-service attacks, which can impair the availability of the services \cite{rampart}.
%
In the past, performance bugs have caused several publicized failures, causing many software projects to be abandoned \cite{perfbugstudy, lessons}.
